# HEKAimport

HEKAimport allows you to handle the bundled ".dat" files produced by the HEKA PatchMaster software. It is currently not feature complete but does provide for the handling of the ".pul" and ".pgf" trees as well as the underlying raw data. This should help in extracting data and the underlying stimulus files. 

Most critical to-do:
* Provide better examples to test the library
* Create a "helper library" for easier access to currents, I-V data, etc.

Done
* Provide backward compatibility for older versions of PatchMaster (Need testing!)
